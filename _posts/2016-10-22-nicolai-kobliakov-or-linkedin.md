### My objective is to rise the senior care in Europe to the level when nobody will be afraid of ageing.

A serial entrepreneur of aged-care domain. I've started a couple of successful Long-Term-Care facilities networks ("Senior Group" in Russia and "Senior Baltic" in Latvia). My objective is to rise the senior care in Europe to the level when nobody will be afraid of ageing. Hope to reach this objective before my generation enters to the third age.
