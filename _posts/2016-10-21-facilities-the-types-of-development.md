# **Facilities, the types of development**

### Currently the aged- care market in CoI consists mainly of Communist- era built facilities, which are quite big (from 100 beds each). Some of them are privatized.

Currently the aged- care market in CoI consists mainly of Communist- era built facilities, which are quite big (from 100 beds each). Some of them are privatized. Also up to 15% of market is served by private residences. Some of them have recently started to be consolidated into the first Senior Care chains (One of the first Polish LTC chains has been acquired in January 2015 by the second- biggest French operator "ORPEA"). So Senior Care market of _COI_ quite resembles the French one in the 80ies.

Our strategy is to develop the chain by

* construction of the new residences on the acquired, or imposed by municipalities landplots (greenfield development)
* acquisition of the functioning residences, which can be extended to 80 beds capacity each, in case they are smaller now.

For construction of the greenfield projects and for the extensions we plan to use mainly the modular elements, which will assure quality, adaptivity and unified prices across different countries. Before the start of the operation the middle personnel will be trained at the existing training center of Senior Baltic, Riga, and the top-level managers --- in France, at Group Almage. The business processes of all the residences will be structured and controlled by specially developed SaaS-based software, already in use for about 1 year in residences started by Senior Group in Russia and Latvia.

> Currently the administrative barriers for entering to the senior domains in the COI are quite low, because the compensation systems are not developed at all.

Currently the administrative barriers for entering to the senior domains in the COI are quite low, because the compensation systems are not developed at all. Some of the selected countries are currently enacting reforms to facilitate the private investments into Senior Care domains.

Also based on the experience in Latvia we can see that the opening of even one modern residence seriously influences the average level of quality of service in all the domain of Senior Care of whole country --- including state-owned and municipal residences, causing the local administrations to really welcome our presence.

Our entry into the market of any "CoI" country means establishment of a de-facto new and higher standard of Senior Care, which in turn will create more opportunities for investment into new and modern facilities.
